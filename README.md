# CITY WEATHER NOW
Weather App built with Open Weather API

## Tech

* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript
* Bootstrap Icons

## Instructions

Enter a city name and hit submit. The display fields will update with the current weather information from that city. Most major cities are respresented in the database and will render a result.

The information rendered is intended to represent the weather at that particular moment and does not project any past or future weather information.

## Developer's Notes:

I had fun building this app and learning to make practical use of an active API.  The imagery  in the background is inspired by my home country of The Bahamas. Enjoy!
